  abstract = {‘Theory’ is one of the most important words in the lexicon of contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite unclear what sociologists mean by the words ‘theory,’ ‘theoretical,’ and ‘theorize.’ I argue that confusions about the meaning of ‘theory’ have brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions: (a) what does ‘theory’ mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what ought ‘theory’ to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about ‘theory.’ Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology to. Fourth, I articulate the question, ‘what ought “theory” to mean?,’ which I dub the ‘semantic predicament’ (SP), and I consider what one can learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a semantic therapy‘ for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP: (a) the principle of practical reason—SP is to a large extent a political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological pluralism—the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and epistemologically demanding.},

  abstract = {Initiating or maintaining phonation during stop closure involves several adjustments, including tongue root advancement to enlarge oral cavity volume (Westbury 1983). Ultrasound imaging shows that in English, the tongue is more advanced for phonologically voiced stops, whether phonated or unphonated (Ahn 2015). The current study uses ultrasound to examine tongue positioning during Hindi stops. Hindi has a unique four-way laryngeal contrast: voiced, murmured, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated. Eight native Hindi speakers recorded phrase-initial stops at three places of articulation (labial, dental, velar) followed by the low vowel /a/. Results show a clear distinction in tongue position between voiced and voiceless unaspirated/aspirated stops. The tongue root is advanced for voiced stops in comparison to voiceless stops. However, there is no difference in tongue root position between voiceless unaspirated and aspirated stops. Murmured stops showed variation among speakers in comparison to other stops, while the majority of speakers show more advanced tongue root compared to voiceless stops. The results suggest that tongue root advancement facilitates phonation in Hindi. Thus, in Hindi, tongue root position corresponds to a phonological distinction in phonation most notably between voiced unaspirated stops and voiceless stops, whereas in English, tongue root position reflects a more abstract phonological distinction in voicing that does not correspond to phonation.}

  abstract = {Why are children better language learners than adults despite being worse at a range of other cognitive tasks? Understanding this can shed new light on the process of first language acquisition and how it differs from that of second language learning, while also providing us with additional tools for teaching second languages effectively. Many accounts focus on the cognitive or neurological differences between children and adults, which are in many ways irreversible. In my work, I focus instead on the way prior knowledge impacts the linguistic building blocks that children and adults use during learning, and how those early building blocks impact learning outcomes. I propose and test the Starting Big Hypothesis: the idea that children's advantage is related to their greater engagement with whole-to-part learning. Specifically, I propose that children rely on both single words and multiword units during learning, while adults do so less (because of their prior knowledge of words), and that this difference can explain (some of) adults' difficulty in learning the grammatical relations between words. I draw on developmental, psycholinguistic and computational findings to show that multiword units are integral building blocks in language; that such units are facilitative for learning certain grammatical relations; and that adult learners rely on them less than children, a pattern that can explain differences between L1 and L2 learning. I will end by discussing implications for models of L1 and L2 learning and the possible role of whole-to-part learning in the emergence of linguistic structure.}

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.}

This volume offers a guide to linguistic data management, engaging with current trends toward the transformation of linguistics into a more data-driven and reproducible scientific endeavor. It offers both principles and methods, presenting the conceptual foundations of linguistic data management and a series of case studies, each of which demonstrates a concrete application of abstract principles in a current practice. In part 1, contributors bring together knowledge from information science, archiving, and data stewardship relevant to linguistic data management. Topics covered include implementation principles, archiving data, finding and using datasets, and the valuation of time and effort involved in data management. Part 2 presents snapshots of practices across various subfields, with each chapter presenting a unique data management project with generalizable guidance for researchers. The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management is an essential addition to the toolkit of every linguist, guiding researchers toward making their data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.}

  abstract = {Developing your philosophical stance can be daunting for new PhD candidates in health professional education. Contemplating the diversity of worldviews in the social sciences may be confronting for those of us from a biomedical background who are unfamiliar with the concepts and unused to metaphysical reflection. However, we need to explore the literature and reflect on our own underlying beliefs to maintain the cohesion of our research. Philosophical stance is generally taken to mean ontology and epistemology, or “what is real” and “how we know what we know”, so developing your philosophical stance involves clarifying your beliefs about the nature of reality and knowledge. Our philosophical stance will influence our research design, practice and reporting. If we are unaware or uncertain of our philosophical stance, we risk misalignment, which will detract from our research claims and undermine their impact. Our philosophical stance is, thus, crucial for ourselves and our audience. This article presents a case study of how my philosophical stance developed over my candidature. I share it to provide insights for others contemplating the same journey. In particular, this paper acknowledges and normalises how understanding and articulating that stance evolved over time.},

  abstract = {Acoustic analysis of nasalized vowels in the frequency domain indicates the presence of extra peaks: one between the first two formants with amplitude P1 and one at lower frequencies, often below the first formant, with amplitude P0. The first-formant amplitude A1 is also reduced relative to its amplitude for an oral vowel. These acoustic characteristics can be explained by speech production theory. The objective of this study was to determine the values for the acoustic correlates A1-P1 and A1-P0 (dB) for quantifying nasalization. They were tested as measures of nasalization by comparing vowels between nasal consonants and those between stop consonants for English speakers. Also, portions of nasal vowels following a stop consonant were compared for speakers of French, which makes a linguistic distinction between oral and nasal vowels. In the analysis of English, the mean difference of A1-P1 measured in oral vowels and nasalized vowels had a range of 10 dB–15 dB; the difference of A1-P0 had a range of 6 dB–8 dB. In the study of French, the difference of A1-P1 measured between the least-nasalized portion and the most-nasalized portion of the vowel had a range of 9 dB–12 dB; for A1-P0, the difference ranged between 3 dB and 9 dB. In order to obtain an absolute acoustic measure of nasalization that was independent of vowel type, normalized parameters were calculated by adjusting for the influence of the vowel formant frequencies.},

It outlines five notions of what has been taken to constitute a “theory”: myth, metaphor, model, hypothesis and structured research programme. The most fundamental of these is the hypothesis. These different ideas of what a theory can be are illustrated with examples from Translation Studies. Any theory aims at description and explanation, and these two concepts are also discussed. A final comment takes up the idea that translations themselves are theories, and that a translator is thus a theorist or               theôros               .},

This study explores the presentation of philosophical assumptions in 1,026 mixed methods research (MMR) articles from the field of education. Eighty-one papers (7.9\%) provided philosophical commitments, and 31 distinct stances were claimed. Philosophy was presented with different roles, including that philosophical stance can direct the decision to use mixed methods or result from that choice. This article contributes the field of MMR by highlighting an oversight in the reporting practices of the MMR community. Possible causes for the findings include weaknesses in research education and knowledge. Alternative models of the research process may be required to accurately match descriptions of research practice.},

We are building off of our success with that title to address the specific challenges that online instructors face in higher education. Author James Lang is partnering with eLearning expert Flower Darby to write and promote the book. RAPIDLY GROWING SEGMENT OF STUDENT POPULATION: According to the Online Learning Consortium, in 2016, 5.8 million students were enrolled in at least one online course. This represents a 263\% increase over the last decade. Two-thirds of these 5.8 million students take online courses through public institutions. ONLINE LEARNING IS PREFERRED BY TODAY'S LEARNER: The Online Learning Consortium study also shows that 90\% of today's student believes online learning is as good as or better than the traditional classroom experience. INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH EDTECH: A survey of university Chief Information Officers shows that 96\% believe adaptive technology has potential to improve student outcomes, while 87\% believe technology provides a richer experience for students. Students agree, except that 4 out of 5 would also say universities should be doing more with technology-based learning experiences. This book will help higher education instructors do that"--},

An X-ray microbeam data base of 2 speakers of American English reciting monosyllabic words, which differed in their final consonants and in their position in the accentual structure of the utterance, was studied to evaluate these three accounts. In this data base, vowel duration differences due to the voicing of the following consonants were amplified by the presence of accent. Also, many of the duration differences associated with the following consonants are localized in the later portion of the opening movement, suggesting that subjects often create vowel duration changes by initiating the consonant closing gesture at an earlier or later time relative to the opening gesture.}

  abstract = {Current attempts at methodological reform in sciences come in response to an overall lack of rigor in methodological and scientific practices in experimental sciences. However, most methodological reform attempts suffer from similar mistakes and over-generalizations to the ones they aim to address. We argue that this can be attributed in part to lack of formalism and first principles. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for formal statistical rigor and scientific nuance in methodological reform. To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (i) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (ii) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (iii) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims.},

More likely, the cortex streams processed information to a still-enigmatic consciousness generator, one perhaps located in the brainstem.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a data-driven model of intelligibility which is intended to be used in an optimization-based model of speech production. The BiLSTM-based model is trained as a phoneme classifier and takes a sequence of real articulatory trajectories as input and returns the probability of phonemes over time. The optimization minimizes a cost function which is the weighted sum of the conflicting demands of being intelligible and least articulatory effort. The data-driven intelligibility model presented in this paper is used to compute the intelligibility score. Simulations support Lindblom’s hypo- and hyper-articulation theory of speech, as the degree of hyper-articulation of speech can be modified and tuned along a continuum by balancing the importance given to both requirements of intelligibility and least articulatory effort.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

  abstract = {One source of phonetic variation is lexical competition, which has been shown to cause both hyperarticulation, especially of vowel formants (e.g., Wright 2004), and reduction, manifested as shorter segment and word durations (Kilanski 2009, Gahl et al. 2012). Studies have found that lexical competition (e.g., having a minimal pair competitor, having more phonological neighbors) causes contrastive hyperarticulation of the initial stop voicing contrast in English: greater competition makes VOT longer for voiceless stops and/or shorter for voiced stops (Baese-Berk \& Goldrick 2009, Nelson \& Wedel 2017). I conducted a corpus study that looked for contrastive hyperarticulation of the final stop voicing contrast in English. The cue examined was preceding vowel duration. I did not find contrastive hyperarticulation: neither minimal pair competitor existence nor higher neighborhood density caused vowels to be longer before final [d] or shorter before final [t]. Instead, both competition metrics correlated with shorter vowel durations before [t] and [d]. This result is consistent with Goldrick et al. (2013)'s failure to find contrastive hyperarticulation of the final stop voicing contrast and their hypothesis that competition affects initial and final contrasts differently. It is also consistent with Gahl et al's (2012) finding that high neighborhood density causes reduction.}

  abstract = {As part of a larger study of the effect of prosody on segmental cues, previous work has shown that in a high pitch environment, F0 is significantly increased relative to a baseline following voiceless obstruents, but F0 closely follows the baseline following voiced obstruents. When a syllable carries a low or no pitch accent, F0 is increased only slightly following all obstruents. It is suggested that this difference occurs because demands of the segmental and prosodic levels of speech production conflict. In particular, results support a theory that the primary feature of voiced or voiceless obstruents is [.-stiff] or [+stiff] vocal folds, respectively. Enhancing features such as [-.spread] or [+spread] vocal folds are secondary. In a high pitch environment, the feature [-.stiff] conflicts with the need to raise pitch. Because of enhancing gestures, the prosodic level can override the segmental. Likewise, in a low pitch environment, the feature [+stiff] conflicts, so the vocal folds will not be stiffened for voiceless obstruents. If so, one might expect that stop consonants in low pitch environments will have longer or stronger prevoicing than in high pitch environments, and preliminary data show that speakers do show this tendency.

In this paper, we present Phonotacticon 1.0, which contains the phonotactic profiles of 516 Eurasian lects retrieved from descriptive literature. The later versions of Phonotacticon will extend beyond Eurasia and will ultimately cover spoken lects in all macroareas. As an example of the research potential of this database in future studies, we have generated from Phonotacticon several descriptive visualizations, such as the distribution of the maximal onset length, to demonstrate the visually discernible areal distribution of certain phonotactic patterns.},

  abstract = {Major changes: The geom\_slabinterval() and geom\_dotsinterval() families gain "sub-guides", which can be passed to the subguide parameter to create axis annotations for the thickness aesthetic (for slabs) and the dot count (for dots) (\#183). The weight aesthetic is now supported in stat\_slabinterval(), including weighted calculations for densities, CDFs, all interval types (quantile intervals, highest density intervals, and highest density continuous intervals), and all point summaries (mean, median, and mode) (\#41). This includes support for the upcoming weighted random variable type in the posterior package. Blurry dotplots are now supported using geom\_blur\_dots(), which accepts an sd aesthetic to set the standard deviation of the blur on each dot. Intervals can also be used in place of blur by passing blur = "interval". This geom is used by the new stat\_mcse\_dots() to show quantiles along with their error using blur (\#63). The new breaks\_quantiles() histogram breaks function allows the construction of quantile histograms with density\_histogram(), stat\_histinterval(), etc. The color ramp scales (e.g. scale\_colour\_ramp\_continuous(), ...) now use an explicit data type, partial\_colour\_ramp(), to encode color ramps and their origin colors, and provide the ramp\_colours() function for applying colour ramps. This should make it easier to pass explicit color ramps without using scale functions, and for packages building on \{ggdist\} to use the colour ramp scales (\#209). Minor changes: The default histogram bin selection algorithm is now "Scott" instead of "Sturges", as "Sturges" tends to be too conservative (\#214). The at parameter to stat\_spike() (or its names) now determines values of an at computed variable, which can be mapped onto aesthetics via after\_stat() to more easily label spikes. (\#203; thanks @mattansb for the suggestion). The arrow parameter is now supported for intervals in geom\_slabinterval() (\#206; thanks to @ASKurz for the suggestion). The default value of overflow in geom\_dotsinterval() is now the new "warn" mode, which works the same as "keep" except that it warns users if the dots will overflow the geometry bounds and suggests solutions (\#213). Optional arguments to automatically partially-applied functions can now be passed a waiver() to use their default value (see auto\_partial()). Several dependency reductions: removed \{cowplot\}, \{purrr\}, \{forcats\}, \{palmerpenguins\}, and \{modelr\} from Suggests; moved \{tidyselect\} and \{dplyr\} from Imports to Suggests. The latter two are only strictly necessary for curve\_interval() due to its use of grouped data frames and tidy selection to specify which columns are conditional and which are joint (the use of grouped data frames with point\_interval() is less strictly necessary, and not used by stats, so is easier to avoid as an absolute dependency). Documentation: The pkgdown documentation now includes an online article on the thickness aesthetic with comprehensive examples of how slab scaling works (\#205). Bug fixes: Ensure Mode() works on analytical constant distributions. Various fixes to ensure compatibility with \{ggplot2\} 3.5.0.},

  abstract = {Across many years of teaching Research Methods and assessing many applications for admission into higher degree studies which require an understanding of theories, principles, strategies and skills needed to complete a higher degree such as a Masters or a PhD, one of the things I have found problematic for many students is the inability to articulate differences between theory, theoretical framework and a conceptual framework for a proposed research project. This paper uses experiential methodology to draw upon my experience in practice, and systematic literature review methodology to draw upon supporting scholarly literature by leaders in the field, to contribute to existing knowledge on the meaning of each of these concepts, and more importantly to distinguish between them in a study of Research Methods, and in particular as they relate to designing a research proposal and a thesis for a higher degree. The primary aim is to help the reader develop a firm grasp of the meaning of these concepts and how they should be used in academic research discourses. The review answers five questions. 1. What does each of these terms mean? 2. When and how should each be used? 3. What purposes does a theoretical framework serve? 4. How do you develop a theoretical framework for your research proposal or thesis? 5. What does a good theoretical framework look like?},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine whether acoustic properties could be derived for English labial and alveolar nasal consonants that remain stable across vowel contexts, speakers, and syllable positions. In experiment I, critical band analyses were conducted of five tokens each of [m] and [n] followed by the vowels [i e a o u] spoken by three speakers. Comparison of the nature of the changes in the spectral patterns from the murmur to the release showed that, for labials, there was a greater change in energy in the region of Bark 5–7 relative to that of Bark 11–14, whereas, for alveolars, there was a greater change in energy from the murmur to the release in the region of Bark 11–14 relative to that of Bark 5–7. Quantitative analyses of each token indicated that over 89\% of the utterances could be appropriately classified for place of articulation by comparing the proportion of energy change in these spectral regions. In experiment II, the spectral patterns of labial and alveolar nasals produced in the context of [s]+nasal ([m n])+vowel ([i e a o u]) by two speakers were explored. The same analysis procedures were used as in experiment I. Eighty-four percent of the utterances were appropriately classified, although labial consonants were less consistently classified than in experiment I. The properties associated with nasal place of articulation found in this study are discussed in relation to those associated with place of articulation in stop consonants and are considered from the viewpoint of a more general theory of acoustic invariance.},

  abstract = {This study reexamines the well-attested coda voicing effect on vowel duration [Chen, Phonetica 22, 125–159 (1970)], in conjunction with the relationship between vowel duration and aspiration of codas. The first step was to replicate the results of Maddieson and Gandour [UCLA Working Papers Phonetics 31, 46–52 (1976)] with a larger, language-specific data set. Four nonsense syllables ending in [open-o] followed by [k, kh, g, gh] were read aloud in ten different carrier sentences by four native speakers of Hindi. Results confirm that longer vowels precede voiced word-final consonants and aspirated word-final consonants. Thus, among the syllables, vowel duration would be longest when preceding the voiced aspirate [gh]. Coda voicing, and thus, vowel duration, have been shown to correlate negatively to vowel F1 in English and ARabic [Wolf, J. Phonetics 6, 299–309 (1978); de Jong and Zawaydeh ibid, 30, 53–75 (2002)]. It is not known whether vowel F1 depends directly on coda voicing, or is determined indirectly via duration. Since voicing and aspiration both increase duration, F1 measurements of this data set (which will be presented) may answer that question.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Giulio Tononi's integrated information theory (IIT) proposes explaining consciousness by directly identifying it with integrated information. We examine the construct validity of IIT's measure of consciousness,               phi               (Φ), by analyzing its formal properties, its relation to key aspects of consciousness, and its co-variation with relevant empirical circumstances. Our analysis shows that IIT's identification of consciousness with the causal efficacy with which differentiated networks accomplish global information transfer (which is what Φ in fact measures) is mistaken. This misidentification has the consequence of requiring the attribution of consciousness to a range of natural systems and artifacts that include, but are not limited to, large-scale electrical power grids, gene-regulation networks, some electronic circuit boards, and social networks. Instead of treating this consequence of the theory as a disconfirmation, IIT embraces it. By regarding these systems as bearers of consciousness               ex hypothesi               , IIT is led toward the orbit of panpsychist ideation. This departure from science as we know it can be avoided by recognizing the functional misattribution at the heart of IIT's identity claim. We show, for example, what function is actually performed, at least in the human case, by the cortical combination of differentiation with integration that IIT identifies with consciousness. Finally, we examine what lessons may be drawn from IIT's failure to provide a credible account of consciousness for progress in the very active field of research concerned with exploring the phenomenon from formal and neural points of view.},

  abstract = {Within quantitative phonetics, it is common practice to draw conclusions based on statistical significance alone. Using incomplete neutralization of final devoicing in German as a case study, we illustrate the problems with this approach. If researchers find a significant acoustic difference between voiceless and devoiced obstruents, they conclude that neutralization is incomplete; and if they find no significant difference, they conclude that neutralization is complete. However, such strong claims regarding the existence or absence of an effect based on significant results alone can be misleading. Instead, the totality of available evidence should be brought to bear on the question. Towards this end, we synthesize the evidence from 14 studies on incomplete neutralization in German using a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis provides evidence in favor of incomplete neutralization. We conclude with some suggestions for improving the quality of future research on phonetic phenomena: ensure that sample sizes allow for high-precision estimates of the effect; avoid the temptation to deploy researcher degrees of freedom when analyzing data; focus on estimates of the parameter of interest and the uncertainty about that parameter; attempt to replicate effects found; and, whenever possible, make both the data and analysis available publicly.}

  abstract = {Abstract             A network of left frontal and temporal brain regions supports language processing. This “core” language network stores our knowledge of words and constructions as well as constraints on how those combine to form sentences. However, our linguistic knowledge additionally includes information about phonemes and how they combine to form phonemic clusters, syllables, and words. Are phoneme combinatorics also represented in these language regions? Across five functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we investigated the sensitivity of high-level language processing brain regions to sublexical linguistic regularities by examining responses to diverse nonwords—sequences of phonemes that do not constitute real words (e.g. punes, silory, flope). We establish robust responses in the language network to visually (experiment 1a, n\,=\,605) and auditorily (experiments 1b, n\,=\,12, and 1c, n\,=\,13) presented nonwords. In experiment 2 (n\,=\,16), we find stronger responses to nonwords that are more well-formed, i.e. obey the phoneme-combinatorial constraints of English. Finally, in experiment 3 (n\,=\,14), we provide suggestive evidence that the responses in experiments 1 and 2 are not due to the activation of real words that share some phonology with the nonwords. The results suggest that sublexical regularities are stored and processed within the same fronto-temporal network that supports lexical and syntactic processes.},

At the same time, meta‐scientific attempts to assess the crisis in more detail have reported substantial difficulties in identifying unambiguous definitions of the scientific claims in published articles and determining how they are connected to the presented evidence. I argue that most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure—they are                 not even wrong                 . Meta‐scientists should beware of the flawed assumption that the psychological literature is a collection of well‐defined claims. To move beyond the crisis, psychologists must reconsider and rebuild the conceptual basis of their hypotheses before trying to test them.},

  abstract = {The Science Delusion is the belief that science already understands the nature of reality. The fundamental questions are answered, leaving only the details to be filled in. In this book (published in the US as Science Set Free), Dr Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world's most innovative scientists, shows that science is being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. The 'scientific worldview' has become a belief system. All reality is material or physical. The world is a machine, made up of dead matter. Nature is purposeless. Consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain. Free will is an illusion. God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls. Sheldrake examines these dogmas scientifically, and shows persuasively that science would be better off without them: freer, more interesting, and more fun.In The God Delusion Richard Dawkins used science to bash God, but here Rupert Sheldrake shows that Dawkins' understanding of what science can do is old-fashioned and itself a delusion},

  abstract = {This study explores how perceptual sensitivities to contextual variability extend to prosodically induced variation. In English, vowel duration is reliably longer preceding a voiced obstruent, as opposed to a voiceless obstruent, and listeners use preceding length as a cue to obstruent voicing (e.g. Raphael, 1972). Segmental duration also co-varies systematically with prosodic position, being longer phrase-finally (e.g. Turk \& Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2007). In this study, we tested the extent to which listeners' categorization of word-final obstruents is altered by the prosodic position of the target. Participants heard a continuum that varied only in vowel length, and categorized stimuli as either “coat” or “code”. Prosodic position in a carrier phrase was manipulated by splicing the target word into either a phrase-final or phrase-medial context. Results show listener expectations about phrase final lengthening mediate categorization, with significantly longer vowel durations required in phrase-final position for a “code” response. The results are discussed in terms of other top-down influences on segmental categorization (e.g. lexical information), and implications for further work on the prosody-phonetics interface.}

Good theories are those that help facilitate this process by being hard to vary: They explain what they are supposed to explain, they are consistent with other good theories, and they are not easily adaptable to explain anything. Here we argue that, rather than a lack of distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research, an abundance of flexible theories is a better explanation for the current replicability problems of psychology. We also explain why popular methods-oriented solutions fail to address the real problem of flexibility. Instead, we propose that a greater emphasis on theory criticism by argument might improve replicability.},

  abstract = {Phonetics is the scientific field concerned with the study of how speech is produced, heard, and perceived. It abounds with data, such as acoustic speech recordings, neuroimaging data, or articulatory data. In this article, we provide an introduction to different areas of phonetics (acoustic phonetics, sociophonetics, speech perception, articulatory phonetics, speech inversion, sound change, and speech technology), an overview of the statistical methods for analyzing their data, and an introduction to the signal processing methods commonly applied to speech recordings. A major transition in the statistical modeling of phonetic data has been the shift from fixed effects to random effects regression models, the modeling of curve data (for instance, via generalized additive mixed models or functional data analysis methods), and the use of Bayesian methods. This shift has been driven in part by the increased focus on large speech corpora in phonetics, which has arisen from machine learning methods such as forced alignment. We conclude by identifying opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Health professions education (HPE) researchers are regularly asked to articulate their use of theory, theoretical frameworks, and conceptual frameworks in their research. However, all too often, these words are used interchangeably or without a clear understanding of the differences between these concepts. Further problematizing this situation is the fact that               theory               ,               theoretical framework               , and               conceptual framework               are terms that are used in different ways in different research approaches. In this article, the authors set out to clarify the meaning of these terms and to describe how they are used in 2 approaches to research commonly used in HPE: the objectivist deductive approach (from theory to data) and the subjectivist inductive approach (from data to theory). In addition to this, given that within subjectivist inductive research               theory               ,               theoretical framework               , and               conceptual framework               can be used in different ways, they describe 3 uses that HPE researchers frequently rely on:               fully inductive theory development               ,               fully theory-informed inductive               , and               theory-informing inductive data analysis.},

  doi = {10.1121/1.5014434},
  abstract = {Vowel duration is determined by a number of factors in American English (e.g., Klatt, 1976), including the tense vs. lax distinction (e.g., /i/-/ɪ/, /u/-/ʊ/) and the relation between duration and vowel height (e.g., Lehiste, 1970). A large body of research has identified segment-internal factors in data averaged over many speakers (e.g., Crystal and House, 1988; Hillenbrand et al., 1995), but few studies have investigated the inherent vowel duration patterns of individuals (cf. House, 1961). Stressed vowel productions ({$>$}2 million tokens) were identified by forced alignment in connected speech recordings of 390 speakers (209 female) from the Mixer 6 corpus (Chodroff et al., 2016). For each speaker, mean durations of ten stressed vowels (/i ɪ e ɛ æ a ʌ o ʊ u/) were calculated after outlier exclusion. The resulting duration patterns were strongly correlated across pairs of speakers (Pearson r: mean = 0.936, 95\% CI [0.935, 0.936], range [0.559, 0.999]), and PCA identified a single component, plausibly indexing global speaking rate, that accounted for more than 82\% of the variance. These results establish that inherent vowel duration is highly uniform across speakers, a type of structured phonetic variation that has implications for models of perceptual adaptation.}

  abstract = {Automatic feature extraction from images of speech articulators is currently achieved by detecting edges. Here, we investigate the use of pose estimation deep neural nets with transfer learning to perform markerless estimation of speech articulator keypoints using only a few hundred hand-labelled images as training input. Midsagittal ultrasound images of the tongue, jaw, and hyoid and camera images of the lips were hand-labelled with keypoints, trained using DeepLabCut and evaluated on unseen speakers and systems. Tongue surface contours interpolated from estimated and hand-labelled keypoints produced an average mean sum of distances (MSD) of 0.93, s.d. 0.46 mm, compared with 0.96, s.d. 0.39 mm, for two human labellers, and 2.3, s.d. 1.5 mm, for the best performing edge detection algorithm. A pilot set of simultaneous electromagnetic articulography (EMA) and ultrasound recordings demonstrated partial correlation among three physical sensor positions and the corresponding estimated keypoints and requires further investigation. The accuracy of the estimating lip aperture from a camera video was high, with a mean MSD of 0.70, s.d. 0.56 mm compared with 0.57, s.d. 0.48 mm for two human labellers. DeepLabCut was found to be a fast, accurate and fully automatic method of providing unique kinematic data for tongue, hyoid, jaw, and lips.},
