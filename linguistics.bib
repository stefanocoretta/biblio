  abstract      = {
    Initiating or maintaining phonation during stop closure involves several
    adjustments, including tongue root advancement to enlarge oral cavity
    volume (Westbury 1983). Ultrasound imaging shows that in {E}nglish, the
    tongue is more advanced for phonologically voiced stops, whether phonated
    or unphonated (Ahn 2015). The current study uses ultrasound to examine
    tongue positioning during Hindi stops. Hindi has a unique four-way
    laryngeal contrast: voiced, murmured, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless
    aspirated. Eight native Hindi speakers recorded phrase-initial stops at
    three places of articulation (labial, dental, velar) followed by the low
    vowel /a/. Results show a clear distinction in tongue position between
    voiced and voiceless unaspirated/aspirated stops. The tongue root is
    advanced for voiced stops in comparison to voiceless stops. However, there
    is no difference in tongue root position between voiceless unaspirated and
    aspirated stops. Murmured stops showed variation among speakers in
    comparison to other stops, while the majority of speakers show more
    advanced tongue root compared to voiceless stops. The results suggest that
    tongue root advancement facilitates phonation in Hindi. Thus, in Hindi,
    tongue root position corresponds to a phonological distinction in phonation
    most notably between voiced unaspirated stops and voiceless stops, whereas
    in {E}nglish, tongue root position reflects a more abstract phonological
    distinction in voicing that does not correspond to phonation.

    Why are children better language learners than adults despite being worse
    at a range of other cognitive tasks? Understanding this can shed new light
    on the process of first language acquisition and how it differs from that
    of second language learning, while also providing us with additional tools
    for teaching second languages effectively. Many accounts focus on the
    cognitive or neurological differences between children and adults, which
    are in many ways irreversible. In my work, I focus instead on the way prior
    knowledge impacts the linguistic building blocks that children and adults
    use during learning, and how those early building blocks impact learning
    outcomes. I propose and test the Starting Big Hypothesis: the idea that
    children's advantage is related to their greater engagement with
    whole-to-part learning. Specifically, I propose that children rely on both
    single words and multiword units during learning, while adults do so less
    (because of their prior knowledge of words), and that this difference can
    explain (some of) adults' difficulty in learning the grammatical relations
    between words. I draw on developmental, psycholinguistic and computational
    findings to show that multiword units are integral building blocks in
    language; that such units are facilitative for learning certain grammatical
    relations; and that adult learners rely on them less than children, a
    pattern that can explain differences between L1 and L2 learning. I will end
    by discussing implications for models of L1 and L2 learning and the
    possible role of whole-to-part learning in the emergence of linguistic
    structure.

  abstract      = {
    Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the
    parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer
    function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in
    R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case
    including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data
    together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the
    profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a
    function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is
    optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to
    provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model,
    the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the
    structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient
    detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who
    wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as
    models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily
    expressible in the formula language used by lmer.

    A guide to principles and methods for the management, archiving, sharing,
    and citing of linguistic research data, especially digital data. “Doing
    language science” depends on collecting, transcribing, annotating,
    analyzing, storing, and sharing linguistic research data. This volume
    offers a guide to linguistic data management, engaging with current trends
    toward the transformation of linguistics into a more data-driven and
    reproducible scientific endeavor. It offers both principles and methods,
    presenting the conceptual foundations of linguistic data management and a
    series of case studies, each of which demonstrates a concrete application
    of abstract principles in a current practice. In part 1, contributors bring
    together knowledge from information science, archiving, and data
    stewardship relevant to linguistic data management. Topics covered include
    implementation principles, archiving data, finding and using datasets, and
    the valuation of time and effort involved in data management. Part 2
    presents snapshots of practices across various subfields, with each chapter
    presenting a unique data management project with generalizable guidance for
    researchers. The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management is an
    essential addition to the toolkit of every linguist, guiding researchers
    toward making their data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
    Reusable.

  abstract      = {
    The effects of voicing, manner, and number of consonants on the duration of
    previous vowels in {E}nglish can be created in three ways: by planned
    expansion or contraction of the entire vowel, by changing the relative
    timing of consonant and vowel gestures, or by modifying the duration of the
    closing movement for the consonants. An X-ray microbeam data base of 2
    speakers of American {E}nglish reciting monosyllabic words, which differed
    in their final consonants and in their position in the accentual structure
    of the utterance, was studied to evaluate these three accounts. In this
    data base, vowel duration differences due to the voicing of the following
    consonants were amplified by the presence of accent. Also, many of the
    duration differences associated with the following consonants are localized
    in the later portion of the opening movement, suggesting that subjects
    often create vowel duration changes by initiating the consonant closing
    gesture at an earlier or later time relative to the opening gesture.

  abstract      = {
    One source of phonetic variation is lexical competition, which has been
    shown to cause both hyperarticulation, especially of vowel formants (e.g.,
    Wright 2004), and reduction, manifested as shorter segment and word
    durations (Kilanski 2009, Gahl et al. 2012). Studies have found that
    lexical competition (e.g., having a minimal pair competitor, having more
    phonological neighbors) causes contrastive hyperarticulation of the initial
    stop voicing contrast in {E}nglish: greater competition makes VOT longer
    for voiceless stops and/or shorter for voiced stops (Baese-Berk \& Goldrick
    2009, Nelson \& Wedel 2017). I conducted a corpus study that looked for
    contrastive hyperarticulation of the final stop voicing contrast in
    {E}nglish. The cue examined was preceding vowel duration. I did not find
    contrastive hyperarticulation: neither minimal pair competitor existence
    nor higher neighborhood density caused vowels to be longer before final [d]
    or shorter before final [t]. Instead, both competition metrics correlated
    with shorter vowel durations before [t] and [d]. This result is consistent
    with Goldrick et al. (2013)'s failure to find contrastive hyperarticulation
    of the final stop voicing contrast and their hypothesis that competition
    affects initial and final contrasts differently. It is also consistent with
    Gahl et al's (2012) finding that high neighborhood density causes
    reduction.

  abstract      = {
    As part of a larger study of the effect of prosody on segmental cues,
    previous work has shown that in a high pitch environment, F0 is
    significantly increased relative to a baseline following voiceless
    obstruents, but F0 closely follows the baseline following voiced
    obstruents. When a syllable carries a low or no pitch accent, F0 is
    increased only slightly following all obstruents. It is suggested that this
    difference occurs because demands of the segmental and prosodic levels of
    speech production conflict. In particular, results support a theory that
    the primary feature of voiced or voiceless obstruents is [.-stiff] or
    [+stiff] vocal folds, respectively. Enhancing features such as [-.spread]
    or [+spread] vocal folds are secondary. In a high pitch environment, the
    feature [-.stiff] conflicts with the need to raise pitch. Because of
    enhancing gestures, the prosodic level can override the segmental.
    Likewise, in a low pitch environment, the feature [+stiff] conflicts, so
    the vocal folds will not be stiffened for voiceless obstruents. If so, one
    might expect that stop consonants in low pitch environments will have
    longer or stronger prevoicing than in high pitch environments, and
    preliminary data show that speakers do show this tendency. [Work supported

  annotation    = {
    Calculating SSANOVA average curves of tongue contours is a technique widely
    used in the field of speech research to facilitate the comparison of
    articulatory data (Davidson, 2006). Even though this technique is visually
    easier to understand and offers better statistical tests than using a
    concentric grid, Mielke (JASA, in press) has recently shown problems
    arising from generating SSANOVA curves in the Cartesian plane and has
    instead suggested the use of polar coordinates. Transferring Cartesian
    coordinates to the polar plane requires choosing an origin for the polar
    coordinate system and we hereby propose an alternative way of doing so by
    estimating the ultrasound transducer position through plotting two lines on
    an ultrasound image. The resulting average curves are very similar to
    Mielke's results but facilitate further analysis of data due to being
    relative to the estimated transducer position. Such possibilities include
    cutting off individual tokens at the edges to avoid wiggly ends of average
    contours, rotating (by adding/subtracting to/from the theta coordinate) and
    shifting data (by changing the x- and y-coordinates of the estimated origin
    in the Cartesian plane) to improve the (visual) comparability of ultrasound
    data across subjects. Some of these techniques were used in Heyne and
    Derrick (SST, 2014).

  abstract      = {
    This study reexamines the well-attested coda voicing effect on vowel
    duration [Chen, Phonetica 22, 125--159 (1970)], in conjunction with the
    relationship between vowel duration and aspiration of codas. The first step
    was to replicate the results of Maddieson and Gandour [UCLA Working Papers
    Phonetics 31, 46--52 (1976)] with a larger, language-specific data set.
    Four nonsense syllables ending in [open-o] followed by [k, kh, g, gh] were
    read aloud in ten different carrier sentences by four native speakers of
    Hindi. Results confirm that longer vowels precede voiced word-final
    consonants and aspirated word-final consonants. Thus, among the syllables,
    vowel duration would be longest when preceding the voiced aspirate [gh].
    Coda voicing, and thus, vowel duration, have been shown to correlate
    negatively to vowel F1 in {E}nglish and {A}Rabic [Wolf, J. Phonetics 6,
    299--309 (1978); de Jong and Zawaydeh ibid, 30, 53--75 (2002)]. It is not
    known whether vowel F1 depends directly on coda voicing, or is determined
    indirectly via duration. Since voicing and aspiration both increase
    duration, F1 measurements of this data set (which will be presented) may
    answer that question.

  abstract      = {
    Within quantitative phonetics, it is common practice to draw conclusions
    based on statistical significance alone. Using incomplete neutralization of
    final devoicing in German as a case study, we illustrate the problems with
    this approach. If researchers find a significant acoustic difference
    between voiceless and devoiced obstruents, they conclude that
    neutralization is incomplete; and if they find no significant difference,
    they conclude that neutralization is complete. However, such strong claims
    regarding the existence or absence of an effect based on significant
    results alone can be misleading. Instead, the totality of available
    evidence should be brought to bear on the question. Towards this end, we
    synthesize the evidence from 14 studies on incomplete neutralization in
    German using a {B}ayesian random-effects meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis
    provides evidence in favor of incomplete neutralization. We conclude with
    some suggestions for improving the quality of future research on phonetic
    phenomena: ensure that sample sizes allow for high-precision estimates of
    the effect; avoid the temptation to deploy researcher degrees of freedom
    when analyzing data; focus on estimates of the parameter of interest and
    the uncertainty about that parameter; attempt to replicate effects found;
    and, whenever possible, make both the data and analysis available publicly.

    This study explores how perceptual sensitivities to contextual variability
    extend to prosodically induced variation. In {E}nglish, vowel duration is
    reliably longer preceding a voiced obstruent, as opposed to a voiceless
    obstruent, and listeners use preceding length as a cue to obstruent voicing
    (e.g. Raphael, 1972). Segmental duration also co-varies systematically with
    prosodic position, being longer phrase-finally (e.g. Turk \&
    Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2007). In this study, we tested the extent to which
    listeners' categorization of word-final obstruents is altered by the
    prosodic position of the target. Participants heard a continuum that varied
    only in vowel length, and categorized stimuli as either ``coat'' or
    ``code''. Prosodic position in a carrier phrase was manipulated by splicing
    the target word into either a phrase-final or phrase-medial context.
    Results show listener expectations about phrase final lengthening mediate
    categorization, with significantly longer vowel durations required in
    phrase-final position for a ``code'' response. The results are discussed in
    terms of other top-down influences on segmental categorization (e.g.
    lexical information), and implications for further work on the
    prosody-phonetics interface.

  abstract      = {
    Vowel duration is determined by a number of factors in American English
    (e.g., Klatt, 1976), including the tense vs. lax distinction (e.g.,
    /i/-/ɪ/, /u/-/ʊ/) and the relation between duration and vowel height (e.g.,
    Lehiste, 1970). A large body of research has identified segment-internal
    factors in data averaged over many speakers (e.g., Crystal and House, 1988;
    Hillenbrand et al., 1995), but few studies have investigated the inherent
    vowel duration patterns of individuals (cf. House, 1961). Stressed vowel
    productions (>2 million tokens) were identified by forced alignment in
    connected speech recordings of 390 speakers (209 female) from the Mixer 6
    corpus (Chodroff et al., 2016). For each speaker, mean durations of ten
    stressed vowels (/i ɪ e ɛ æ a ʌ o ʊ u/) were calculated after outlier
    exclusion. The resulting duration patterns were strongly correlated across
    pairs of speakers (Pearson r: mean = 0.936, 95% CI [0.935, 0.936], range
    [0.559, 0.999]), and PCA identified a single component, plausibly indexing
    global speaking rate, that accounted for more than 82% of the variance.
    These results establish that inherent vowel duration is highly uniform
    across speakers, a type of structured phonetic variation that has
    implications for models of perceptual adaptation.
